REM Exercise 6: JWT Authentication Testing Commands (Windows CMD)
REM These commands demonstrate the pure JWT authentication flow

REM 1. Register a new user
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"username\":\"alice\",\"password\":\"secret123\"}" http://127.0.0.1:5000/register

REM 2. Login with credentials in JSON body (NOT Basic Auth) to get JWT token
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"username\":\"alice\",\"password\":\"secret123\"}" http://127.0.0.1:5000/login

REM 3. Access user profile with JWT token (replace YOUR_TOKEN with actual token from step 2)
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:5000/profile

REM 4. Get all users with JWT token (replace YOUR_TOKEN with actual token)
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:5000/users

REM 5. Access protected resource with JWT token (replace YOUR_TOKEN with actual token)
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:5000/protected

REM 6. Try to access protected endpoint WITHOUT token (should fail with 401)
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/profile

REM 7. Try to login with invalid credentials (should fail with 401)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"username\":\"alice\",\"password\":\"wrongpassword\"}" http://127.0.0.1:5000/login

REM Note: In PowerShell, use commands_powershell.txt instead for better token handling
