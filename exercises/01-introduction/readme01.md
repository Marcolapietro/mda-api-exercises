# Exercise 1: Introduction to APIs

## Quick Start

- This is a theory/overview exercise. There is no app to run.
- Read through the concepts, then proceed to Exercise 2 to practice with Postman.

## Objective
Understand what an API is and its importance in software development. Identify examples of popular APIs and their uses.

## Description
In this exercise, you will research the concept of API (Application Programming Interface), its basic functionality, and its relevance in the world of software development. Additionally, you will identify and describe at least three popular APIs, explaining their purpose and how they are used.

## Requirements
1. **API Definition:**
   - Write a clear and concise definition of what an API is.
   - Briefly explain how APIs work in the context of web applications.

2. **Importance of APIs:**
   - Describe why APIs are important in modern software development.
   - Mention at least two key benefits of using APIs.

3. **Examples of Popular APIs:**
   - Select at least three widely used APIs in the industry.
   - For each API, provide:
     - **API Name**
     - **Brief Description**: What it does and what it is used for.
     - **Common Use**: Examples of applications or services that use it.
     - **Link to official documentation** (if publicly available).

4. **Submission Format:**
   - Create a Markdown document (`introduction.md`) containing all the requested information.
   - Ensure the document is well-structured and easy to read.

## Suggested Steps

1. **Research:**
   - Search for information about APIs in resources such as official documentation, technical articles, and tutorials.

2. **Define API:**
   - Based on your research, write your own definition of API.

3. **Explore the Importance of APIs:**
   - Think about how APIs facilitate integration between different services and applications.
   - Identify benefits such as modularity, scalability, and code reusability.

4. **Select and Describe Popular APIs:**
   - Choose 1 API that is relevant and widely recognized, such as:
     - **Google Maps API**
     - **Twitter API**
     - **Stripe API**
   - Research each one to see what they are used for.

5. **Mention frameworks used for API development.**
   - Conduct a search about different API development frameworks.
