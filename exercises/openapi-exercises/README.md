# OpenAPI Exercises

This folder offers two ways to learn OpenAPI:

- `00-openapi-playground/` — Lightweight, explore-first tasks in Swagger Editor. Tweak a tiny spec, see changes live, play with examples and responses.
- `01-openapi-end-to-end/` — Author a clean spec, apply good design patterns (pagination, filtering, consistent errors), and optionally try contract‑first codegen (server stub + client SDK) on your machine.

Tip: Start with the Playground to get comfortable with the UI, then do the End‑to‑End when ready.
