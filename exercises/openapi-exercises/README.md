# OpenAPI/Swagger Exercises - Understanding API Documentation

## What You'll Learn

Instead of focusing on writing YAML syntax, this exercise helps you understand:
- **Why API documentation matters** - Experience the difference between documented and undocumented APIs
- **What problems OpenAPI/Swagger solves** - Automatic documentation, interactive testing, client generation
- **How to use Swagger UI** - Explore and test APIs interactively
- **How OpenAPI integrates with tools** - Import into Postman, generate collections automatically
- **Industry standards** - Explore real-world API specifications from GitHub, Stripe, etc.

## Exercise Structure (40-50 minutes)

### Part 1: The Problem and The Solution (20-25 minutes)
First, experience the frustration of working with an undocumented API. Then, see the same API with Swagger UI and discover how interactive documentation changes everything.

**Location:** `01-problem-and-solution/`

### Part 2: Postman Integration (10 minutes)
Learn how OpenAPI specs integrate with Postman - automatic collection generation from a single file.

**Location:** `02-postman-integration/`

### Part 3: Real-World APIs (15 minutes)
Explore OpenAPI specifications from real companies like GitHub, Stripe, and Twilio. See industry standards and best practices.

**Location:** `03-real-world-apis/`

## Quick Start

1. Read each part's README in order
2. Follow the hands-on activities
3. Complete the reflection questions at the end

## Key Takeaway

OpenAPI/Swagger isn't about learning YAML syntax - it's about:
- **Better Developer Experience** - Self-documenting APIs
- **Faster Integration** - Clients know exactly what to expect
- **Reduced Errors** - Clear contracts prevent mistakes
- **Tooling Ecosystem** - Postman, code generation, testing tools all work with OpenAPI
